# Tarot API

This is a pure rails 5 API for interacting with a virtual tarot deck. Users can
shuffle/draw cards at random into some different spreads.
Cards are fully fleshed out with short meanings, full meanings, and keyword meands for upright and reversed card positions.
Images from the original rider-waite deck are used as they are public domain.
